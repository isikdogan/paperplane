## PaperPlane: A static blog generator
---

PaperPlane is a very simple, flat-file, static blog generator. Originally, I made it to create [my personal homepage](http://www.isikdogan.com/). Feel free to use it to create yours.

#### PaperPlane is fast
The pages are all pre-rendered therefore load fast. No server-side querying is needed to display the pages.

#### Requires no database
The data is stored in a folder containing a flat text file for each blog entry.

#### Compatible
PaperPlane generated blogs can run on any HTML hosting service (Google Cloud Storage, GitHub, Dropbox, etc.).

#### Secure
No scripts run on the server side.

#### Easy to create content
PaperPlane support simple [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) formatting.

#### Easy to embed videos
You can easily embed videos using `[vid]link[/vid]` tags.

#### Easy to create themes
PaperPlane uses [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/) template engine, [Bootstrap 3.0](http://getbootstrap.com/) HTML/CSS framework, and [FontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/) icon collection.

#### Multi-platform
PaperPlane is written in Python.

#### Free and open source
The PaperPlane project is released under the terms of the [MIT license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License). You can download/fork the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/isikdogan/paperplane).
